According to technology website Engadget reports, Joint Photographic Experts Group (Joint Photographic Experts Group, hereinafter \"JPEG\") recently launched a \"privacy and security\" project, which can make ordinary JPEG format pictures, rather than just pictures in JPEG 2000 format supports digital rights management (DRM) technology. This program can encrypt metadata (such as photo sites) to protect users \' privacy, but may also prevent users from copying or opening a portion of the image.

However, the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) to the JPEG committee has proposed a \"middle way\", it was aware that the encrypted data as a filter (for example, ensure that only the user\'s Facebook friends can see a photograph) the value, but you do not want any data that cannot be removed or is used to prevent the images from being copied.

Though JPEG team may not take this suggestion seriously, but it will at least know they have other options.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: Science and technology , The Internet
