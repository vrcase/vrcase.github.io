Origin and C4 has great brand of music he also launched several of its professional players, L5 PRO is one of the latest products. ![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5564/30780999035_08890c232d_b.jpg)L5 PRO package uses black as the keynote, there is not much modified, only the brand logo. ![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5707/30692494481_0f00c63892_b.jpg)Open the package, box there are two black boxes, one player, another is related accessories. ![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5471/30692500341_ef027ae307_b.jpg)Positive and L5 L5 PRO is similar, but with OGS+IPS screen. 480*320 screen size is 3.5 inches, for a player to say, we are not asking too much of the screen, after all, this is not a phone. ![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5448/30781016425_ec44755b5b_b.jpg)Package descriptions are at the bottom, don\'t say because we got the audition tour testing, manuals and other accessories are missing. ![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5680/30744396976_520a55eb22_b.jpg)Work, as always, spot on, the front panel using the drawing process, fuselage using the 6-series is made of magnesium alloy coupled with CNC technology. ![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5570/30744401306_f63caeeff9_b.jpg)Top fuselage has C1 and C2 two customizable function keys, there is a lock button on the far right, there is a volume knob on the right side.  [VR Shinecon virtual reality headset](http://www.recode.net/2016/7/22/12232072/virtual-reality-stanford-university-demos-empathy-memory-gaming-podcast)![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5346/30479983650_7ed537b4b9_b.jpg)The front engraved with the brand logo, front design and L5 are exactly the same. ![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5744/30664160782_c265915e54_b.jpg)L5 PRO feature is back after the addition of a piece of red sandalwood wood cover, engraved with the brand logo and name, to further improve the texture of the fuselage, but also enhanced the whole player\'s temperament. ![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5555/30145404843_71ff360b09_b.jpg)As a result of the solid wood back cover, so every L5 PRO rear cover is unique, wood elements players familiar with C4, LP5 and other products. The side there are three play key, respectively, play/pause, fast forward/previous song and fast back/next song. 3.5mm headphone jack at the bottom of the fuselage, 3.5mm line out/coaxial outlet, microUSB port and a microSD card slot, after all, the characteristics of the L5 PRO function with USB DAC. Although can\'t say very strong with extended functionality, but also enough. Accessory packaging has a leather Holster, and the USB data cable. Comes with leather texture, gold-plated cable interface, with grading rings. [VR headset](http://www.vrburg.com/)[![Alt VR headset](http://www.vrburg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vrshinecon_vr006_lrg.jpg)](http://www.vrburg.com/) Higher degree of fit of the leather, keys and parts have a hollowing out of the interface. A fever-level player itself is to be based on \"the voice\" on the basis of the L5 PRO comes to work in this regard, of course, from the point of view of sound quality, L5 L5 PRO compared to before and there is no qualitative leaps, change is part of amp and circuit design. Slightly high frequency sound overall style and balance to, low-frequency texture well, not a very large amount. However after careful listening, L5 transverse acoustic PRO significantly greater degrees of separation there is significantly increased. Similar to the overall style and the L5, but sound only to warmer, low frequency has some improvements. Multiple gain settings of the successor to the L5, L5 PRO still has a Ultra Low to gain Ultra High five, and gain set-up is more mature than before, in Ultra High thrust than under other modes will be greatly improved, and on this basis, too rushed and does not have voice problems. And Ultra Low mode you can adjust some low impedance headphones, for example, some units moving iron, ferrous headphones in this mode can sound softens to some extent relative to L5, L5 PRO also changed to a certain extent because open low gain mode dynamic loss problems. Le pet home, in contrast to the more high-end LP5 Gold Edition, L5 PRO in terms of amount of the necessity for some, LP5 Gold version sound more atmospheric style of splendid, while ensuring sound depth and transparency, in promoting the high impedance headphones, LP5 Gold Edition is undoubtedly better. Adaptation music types there is a big difference between the two, LP5 Gold Edition can be said to be designed for classical music, while the L5 PRO is more suitable for a general audience fond of pop music. Finally there is one of the most important issues, that is, L5 PRO face significantly higher. As a type of \"brick\", L5 PRO sound is worthy for the price, but for many users, the cost nearly 5000 Yuan to buy a player, after all, is too extravagant, most play machine is probably more interested in easy to use mobile phone to enjoy the music. Brick loved by more and more users, but after all, it is a niche product, so many brands in the case of sound quality, ignoring the many other user experience. L5 PRO in quality and sense of hearing has achieved a good balance, and that absolutely any product shape called a \"high face values\" representative if operating experience and continues to work on the extension, I believe it will allow more users to accept.
