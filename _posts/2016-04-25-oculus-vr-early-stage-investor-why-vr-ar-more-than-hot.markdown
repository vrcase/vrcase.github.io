But in his view there was no enough good \"stories\" make virtual reality devices to \"talk\": \"I think it (virtual reality) is not a technical issue, but a matter of creativity. ”And in Holland, in addition to the stories, VR also has a wide coverage of the character, \"it touches everything, is not only a great movie and game, can also help in education, health care, VR can help you learn a language, or the treatment of certain diseases.\" He believes many killer applications haven\'t received enough recognition, \"tourism and education over the next ten years will be (VR) killer app.\"VR from an early age what\'s the key to the public?[![Alt MIU MIU iPhone 5 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/iphone5/miu_miu_iphone_case_ip4908_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/miu-miu-bag-design-silicone-case-for-iphone-5-5s-black-p-3594.html)Plumer, Oculus VR has focused on large game areas, but what makes VR to a wide range of mobile products. \"The first 1 million people access to VR must be by Cardboard instead of Oculus, so mobile VR field will have plenty of opportunities in the short term ... ... Both Sony and Microsoft want to breakthrough in VR should start from mobile. ”Chennavasin believes would not have a suitable for everyone\'s killer application, \"like TV, different people like different content, so for the VR, we need to create enough different types of experience to catch as many different types of people. ”Corazza also believe opportunities lie in the vertical area, and in a vertical field to create superior VR experience will allow VR into more people\'s lives, \"such as millions of painting, 3D, VR\'s painting was phenomenal.\"Hollenbeck considered developers instead focused attention on how to enable the VR to the public, it would be better focused on segment, \"do what you are interested in, you know, to attract part of your product groups with high enthusiasm\".VR entrepreneur how to impress the VC?To address this problem, all guests are considered a superior demo is the most important.In Holland\'s view, a good virtual reality demo application is not only an attractive enough, and its experience in virtual reality also needs to be good enough, it is hard to convince people that \"VR will be the future trend.\" He even thinks Google Cardboard are at risk because of the simplistic: \"I appreciated them bringing virtual reality to shuyishiwan of thousands of people, but the experience was not good enough Cardboard, by contrast I prefer Gear VR, it brings really good mobile VR experience. ”Hollenbeck emphasized three points: smart, passionate, great demo.Chennavasin added that VR application scope is not limited to games, but mining is big, and developer, do a demo of different type of VR applications with others more likely to attract the attention of investors.
