Originally a single thumbs up click on the like button (like), is extended to six Facebook users most want to express emotion symbols. For years rumors don\'t like buttons (dislike) does not appear, the obvious reason is that it will spread too much negative energy.\"The significance of change click on the like button like in coke to change its secret formula. \"In a feature article in Bloomberg business week tells the story of Facebook like function changes, from which we can learn about this company\'s product development process.1 whyClick on the like button is a simple and easy to use features, but also a hard blunt instrument--when posted on Facebook, such as divorce, when news of the disaster, my friends sometimes conveniently point out praise. Facebook has long realized the problem, its Chief Product Officer Chris Cox (Chris Cox) declared war on the praise button several times before, but didn\'t think was good enough idea. Cox said: \"as far as the way people use Facebook, this is the key, and need to be extra careful to not put people off, it doesn\'t disrupt people\'s experience. ”A year ago, a meeting of the Executive meeting, Cox 6 companions listed on site they want to 3 projects to 2015.

Eyes become heart emoticons, with pounding beats red animated emoticons as well as \"I love you\" and other expressions are classified \"love\" category. And they will be the categories extremely refined and made into 6 different generic replies, Facebook called \"Reactions\" (reaction): anger, sadness, surprise, lol, cheers and love.

If said points praise of intended is to let interactive more easily, like Dang a friends found new work Shi, just to in he of post following points a praise, without followed front of comments who wrote Shang cookie of \"congratulations congratulations\", so added of expression not only is expected to inspired more user of expression to, especially too lazy to typing of user, and will let Facebook master more user of information, to better to sold advertising.3 How to addSo here\'s the thing, an Internet product is simple to use, with more people.
