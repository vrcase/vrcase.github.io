![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7305/27751597312_c2b9b4794f_b.jpg)Anticipated phone 5 on February 24 and we finally met this is millet after 1.5 years of a new Orthodox millet series flagship. What bright spot does it have? We start today\'s evaluation: PS: this evaluation using the phone 5 with high version (Xiao long 820 2.15GHz,3G+64G, glass cover, price 2299) machine, for reference onlyOut of the box and look![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7463/27751607082_4f6d4c2cfc_b.jpg)Phone 5 (hereinafter millet 5) packaging and red rice Note3 stylistically similar white carton with a color rendering is used. ![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7717/27818598696_8e1c0c1ab2_b.jpg)Package remains on the back of the relevant parameters, millet 5 using Xiao long 820 2.15GHz processor, this is also the first official opening of Xiao long 820 mobile phone. 5.15 inches 1080P screen, pre press-type fingerprint identification, post-16 million pixels with optical image stabilization camera, front facing 4 million pixel camera, battery capacity is 3000mAh. ![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7715/27853127995_4a26b2f887_b.jpg)Front still has a matte protective coating. ![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7354/27575188080_cb53660052_b.jpg)Accessories are simple, power adapter, USB Type-C cables and card PIN. ![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7358/27575193460_b347df124e_b.jpg)Power adapter supports high throughput QC3.0, stalls with various voltage, typical output 5V 2.5A, 9V 2A and 12V 1.5A three, up to 18W of power. ![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7447/27575198800_2dc50af92d_b.jpg)Data cable USB Type-C interface, this is millet\'s second product that uses the interface. ![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7504/27240888293_095acd315d_b.jpg)Fuselage is a traditional style of millet, millet logo in the upper left, the special is its front-Home key, and press-type fingerprint recognition.![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7449/27575211280_709ee5aa91_b.jpg)Millet 5 ultra narrow frame design, phone volume control very well. ![Alt Xiao long phone 5 820 strength hand evaluation](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7101/27818631216_8d5491b8f4_b.jpg)Note receiver design and millet was close, Groove-type receiver, front UltraPixel 4 million pixel camera.Millet 5 millet first joined the Home key of an entity of a cell phone, the keys at the same time with press-type fingerprint recognition capabilities. But millet 5 fingerprint recognition the smaller contact area than other similar products and keys appear more slender.Home button multitasking on the left key back key on the right side, with a White Backlight, backlight off and light up when some \"stupid cute.\" Home keys but too low and wide \"JAWS\" with always seem less coordination.Back cover there is a large area of 3D glasses, which is a continuation of the millet Note design language. 3D glass gives a strong sense of the icing, just look at the back cover, then it\'s more like a trumpet Note of millet. Back with double curved glass, millet called the 3D glasses. Different millet 5 on the metal frame of the design matures, arc continues to the back of the border, to feel better. Phone card slots in the left side of the fuselage. Support two Nano-sim cards, Netcom, supports the three major domestic carriers, and two card slots are telecom card can be inserted. Volume button and the power button on the right side of the fuselage.Can see more hyperbole than millet Note large inner borders, extend from the top of the fuselage to the fuselage side using a wider and more curved design. Rear camera was upgraded to 16 million pixels, using the Sony IMX298 sensor, with a four-axis optical image stabilization, 6P lens, F2.0 aperture. Camera without fuselage height 7.25 mm, control well. With 3.5 mm headphone jack at the top of the fuselage, and retained the IR function.Millet 5 used in the mounting of USB Type-C design, the left and right sides of the receiver and speakers separately on the USB interface.System and function Millet 5 uses the latest version of Android based 6.0 MIUI 7.1, the overall operation and UI, and used to be very close to, of course, also adding some new features. Millet 5 rejoins the NFC functionality, and called it \"full NFC\", you can brush through NFC bus cards, bus cards such as filling operations. NFC transit card functionality is integrated into the millet purse.When the bus passes near the mobile NFC coil, you can query the most recent consumer records. Millet 5 retained the IR sensor can keep the cell phone acts as a remote control of various electrical appliances. Millet 5 also includes a key for the function, convenient user millet for a new phone.  []() Millet 5 is the first predecessor entities phone Home key, the entity key can also be achieved when in daily touch home key function. But more difficult to understand is touch and press this button to achieve the same functionality and cannot be set. Standard Edition and high with millet 5 are \"only\" 3G of RAM, boot 1.7G available, and to optimize space. Millet 5 using a press-type fingerprint recognition, entry and use, and other products of the same type are similar, not much different, but it\'s significantly smaller sensors and the contact area of the finger. In addition, fingerprinting is similar to unlock Samsung mobile phone, you need to light up the screen and lock screen down the finger on the sensor does not automatically unlock.PerformanceAs the new flagship of millet, millet 5 as you would like to use Qualcomm\'s new flagship Xiao long 820, and uses the 3G, LPDDR4, UFS2.0 and other high-end hardware, it is also the first mass market sale (March 1) Xiao long 820 mobile phone. [![Alt iPhone 6 case Givenchy](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6/givenchy_i6300_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/givenchy-iphone-6-case-rottweiler-p-4363.html)Xiao long quad-core 820 used Kryo core, which independent research and development of high-performance 64-bit processor is Qualcomm, one of the two core 2.15GHz, the other two core 1.593GHz,CPU Model MSM8996, stepping is r1p2. GPU is also most Qualcomm Adreno 530@624MHz, very powerful, beyond Apple\'s A9 processor is the most powerful GPU graphics performance on a mobile phone. Worth mentioning is the GPU driver version V141 millet 5, this is as good as a son Nexus series. We conducted routine tests--rabbit testing, close to 140,000, though, and officials say a slight gap (exclude privilege that is to use a more powerful version of the test), but relative to competing products, has called lonely seeking abortion. Another famous tests Geekbench 3, single-core performance smoothly over 2300, multicore is more than 5300 points, well, including highest single-core performance in the Android mobile phones. We also test for PI and RAR, PI in General, spent almost 25 seconds, but we cannot ask for a quad-core product is too harsh. RAR performance good, but although there are only four threads up to more than 1800 points, comparable to the number eight threads of mobile phones. Sunspider test is generally not even good Xiao long 810. AndroBench disk test, sequential read and write, random read performance is outstanding performance in UFS2.0 than S6, Meizu Pro 5 equivalent to type more. Random write performance in General, not any better than the eMMC 5.0 product.For millet 5 run we can be compared and other high-end phones, can be seen more in some Xiao long thread test 820 also showed no gap larger than the multi-core SoC what.Geekbench test, millet 5 single core performance is amazing, second only to the iPhone 6s Plus, multi-core performance also drew eight core of Galaxy Note5, performance is excellent. A1 SD Bench compared with UFS2.0 of strong, millet 5 even in reading performance significantly beyond the Galaxy Note5, but write performance is not eye-catching.We\'ll use @ioncannon production of CPU Burn to test some millet 5 performance, single floating point performance at 44-45GFLOPS, surpassing the previous best Kirin 950 (A72 2.3GHz), nuclear power beyond 3500mW (can test software is incorrect, for reference purposes only). Cache Test can be seen in the Xiao long 820 Second-level cache in 1.5M. We also tried the Quad open (say for a long time did not play only a quad-core Android phone ... ) And floating point performance in 120GFLOPS, between eight-core fully open Exynos 7420 and Kirin 950, have been very difficult for a quad-core product. While surpassed 8000mW power consumption (can test software is wrong, is only for reference), this is what we did not anticipate than Exynos 7420 and Kirin 950 eight-core CPU or higher. And stability, we open a quad-core CPU Burn open full, quad-core from 0-27 can keep open full-frequency operation, then nuclear block to 2080MHz, by 1 minutes, 50 seconds, each core frequency begins. Overall performance is satisfactory, compared to Xiao long 810 has increased substantially, and Kirin 950 compared to the normal level of frequency stability is almost cooked. In daily use, Xiao long quad-core 820 is also very easy to reach full run and high frequency, the response speed of the system as a whole is very good. Application for daily use during dynamic core moved to the 1GHz in order to save power. [iPhone 6 case Givenchy](http://www.nodcase.com/givenchy-iphone-6-case-rottweiler-p-4363.html) We also had a \"metaphysical curve\" tests, run third-party applications and mobile phone Sina weibo Taobao, are remarkable, high-performance CPU, ultra high bandwidth with the 1080P resolution, millet 5 can be said that there is no reason not to smooth. PhotosMillet 5 using 16 million megapixel rear camera, Sony IMX298 sensor, with the \"four-axis optical image stabilization\", F2.0 aperture, on the configuration of the camera in relation last-generation products has increased significantly. Pictures continued the consistent MIUI interface styles, believe used users are very easy to use. We use iPhone 6s also uses optical image stabilization Plus as the object of comparison, look at millet 5 photos:IPhone 6s Plus take the same picture (click to see original image)Millet 5 take the same picture (click to see original image)This set of proofs from the resolution not much gap between, but millet 5 slightly overexposed, iPhone 6s Plus color and brightness control are doing a better job.IPhone 6s Plus take the same picture (click to see original image)Millet 5 take the same picture (click to see original image)This set of proofs millet 5 has more detail, more bright colors, however, it is evident the picture noise color seriously, seen from the EXIF information, iPhone is 6s Plus ISO down as far as possible, longer shutter time, get a better purity. Millet high ISO problem occurs between the two groups, so that the picture looks too much noise. But millet 5 can use four-axis vibration reduction to achieve a longer exposure time, improving the ISO is not a very good low light solution.  [Givenchy iPhone 6 cover](http://cathkidstoncase.blogspot.com/2016/04/musk-super-high-speed-lines-cost-real.html)Millet has 5 supports the \"NET 3.0\" black technology, it in full on the basis of the NET 2.0 can still improve, specifically in the main card while using mobile/Unicom 4G, Deputy 3G can also be used for voice calls. Another black millet 5 three-carrier aggregation network of science and technology, because the domestic network restrictions, we cannot test. Charging test, we in the case of the remaining 4% the original power adapter for recharging, can reach 7.41V 2.07A, total power exceeds 15W, did well. Common voltage 5V, 9V, such is not used, can also be seen millet 5 using high-throughput QC3.0 technology (200mV voltage for a document, and to improve charging efficiency). Charging time connection, we use the original power adapter for charging, starting from 4% to 100%, about 78 minutes, doing rather well.SummaryFrom this simple to use experience, millet 5 brings us a lot of surprises, strong performance, better camera and contoured feel, remained cost-effective under these hardware upgrade, so that consumers can experience at around 2000 Yuan price to a \"faster\" mobile phone. Of course, the millet 5 still have some small problems, such as entity keys function set unreasonable, take pictures too much noise and Flash to read slower. More and more experience on millet 5, please attention our follow-up review.TipsMicro sweep sweep, author tips bar -1897 votesMillet 5\rMillet +3D Mobile 5 3D glass ceramics (zirconium-ceramic Nano-ceramic) fuselage, 5.15 inches screen, Gao Tongxiao 820 processor, Lei said phone 5-rabbit run as high as 140,000 +.
