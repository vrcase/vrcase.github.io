Can be seen as apart from the solids, liquids and gases \"fourth State of matter\", but plasma is the most common material universe, accounting for 99% of all visible matter.　　Plasma is different from other substances, because it is composed of charged particles (negative) and Atom (positive charge), any movement of charged particles, such as: move inside the plasma, magnetic field will be established, and can be manipulated using magnetic or electric fields, rather than inert gas.　　But here\'s the thing, is a basic plasma physics magnetic reconnection process, appeared in the plasma to collide with different magnetic field, when the plasma\'s magnetic field close to each other, across magnetic field lines will be changed and rearranged into a new structure of the magnetic field, releasing large amounts of energy.　　This means that two-blade lightsaber pile up, it is almost impossible to avoid magnetic reconnection, the results will produce an explosion. Two swordsman\'s body will come face to face the two sides at the moment were instantly vaporized by powerful energy.[![Alt Flawless i6 case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6/flawless_i63802_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/beyonce-flawless-iphone-6-case-p-5281.html)　　There is also a little more interesting is that hot, high temperature is one of the way to let the blade release light. For example: the Sun is a glowing plasma ball, its heat from the core of fusion reactions. All hot objects emit a specific wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, its color depends on the temperature level only, it will appear red under low temperature, high temperature will appear blue. This may be the basic principles of light sabers glow, if you have a dangerous light sword, is likely to be a blue lightsaber, its lethality is greater.
