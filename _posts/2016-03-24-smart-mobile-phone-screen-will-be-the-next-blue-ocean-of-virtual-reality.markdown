\"Editor\'s note\" the writer Signe Brewster, the original quote from GigaOmWhy every time I enter the world of virtual reality, zombies will appear? Never mind, I have a gun in hand, you can shoot them down. Then began approaching monsters hiding in the corner, and suddenly, a voice, what\'s going on?A hollow voice reminds me that I\'m very close to wall. If I continue to move forward, in reality may not be my gun shot through the wall.The scenario described above is common in virtual reality, you forget you are in a really small room, you\'re not a hand-held large assault rifles, shot and killed people. But the most unusual is that, I didn\'t use the Oculus of the gorgeous high-definition screen, but on the Smartphone screen.![Alt Smart mobile phone screen will be the next blue ocean of virtual reality?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1499/25902020842_eb97393d16_z.jpg)Of course, the phone\'s screen is transformed into virtual reality helmet technology has also recently raised in sudden rise on the website. Last week was the outgoing message, Samsung is already developing its own unique technology. Actually, the principle of smart phones and has a dedicated suite of the screen is the same: viewers will see two almost identical side by side picture, apart from minor changes from different locations.![Alt Smart mobile phone screen will be the next blue ocean of virtual reality?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1475/25390056524_6c47384b2d_z.jpg)Users only need to download a mobile application, in front of the phone plug in the headset to load application. Accelerometers and other sensors on your phone works with some small items, head tracking and interaction to achieve realistic goals.[![Alt virtual reality goggles](http://www.everweek.com/images/large/virtual_reality/3d_headset_vr001_lrg.jpg)](http://www.everweek.com/google-cardboard-3d-video-virtual-reality-headset-for-4-3-5-5-smartphones-p-2811.html)But, in any case, I\'m highly suspicious of these principles. There is no doubt that virtual reality requires highly specialized screens and electronic configuration, which is not a mobile phone can provide.These questions in my last week Augmented disappeared after the World Expo. Prototype of Sulon and VRelia I have tried, which is based on the phone\'s screen as their virtual reality screen. I sat back with VRelia GO helmet roller coaster, also visited a luxurious House. Sulon Cortex is able to virtual reality technology combined with augmented reality technology, gives a completely different experience.They completely took me by surprise. Of course, the image does not use Oculus Rift seen as clear, but headphones play an important role: they made me feel like I have seen is real, evidence that you don\'t need a Super clear and vivid image, to make you fully immersed in a virtual world.

For those who want to spend $ 50 for people who will be able to experience the virtual reality technology, Smartphone screens may not be their one good choice!After saying these, I recall previously seen on the YouTube video, titled United States MIT amazing invention of gifted students. Roughly speaking we do not need a specific screen, a piece of white paper, a desktop can be the cell phone screen, using virtual reality technology is extreme. Most of the comments are \"lack of creativity our students too,\" and really hope to see more of this new creation.Related: [virtual reality goggles](http://www.everweek.com/google-cardboard-3d-video-virtual-reality-headset-for-4-3-5-5-smartphones-p-2811.html)Augmented reality Expo: AR a from being the outbreak \"Oculus Rift\"
