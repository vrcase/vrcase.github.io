Lei feng\'s network: the writer steamed buns (micro-letter number: PRODUCTER), Alibaba\'s product manager.Message push is one of the most common functions in product design, but someone in the small function point is always making mistakes. So, while we are designing a message push, need to pay attention to what point?![Alt Let users do not push the objectionable message, you should pay attention to in the design of these](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7313/27598571595_8d0261cd90_z.jpg)\"Hey, there\'s a demand! Here we need to send a message to touch the user, message text will give you trouble under as quickly as possible. ”A Word needs, if you are developing a GG, you meet such needs?Not, why?In fact, consider this demand, there are a lot of problems:In what channel 1, message notification to users?2, sending frequency control is how much?Paragraph 3, appropriate messages contact up to user time?4, message copy is fixed or semi-fixed half configured?5, touching to which users?……Besides, the further dismantling will also breed their own details, these will be the following one by one in detail.Touch-up channelChannels? Channel。 Very simple, today I want to from the starting point a to destination b, choice of transportation: bicycles, buses, taxis, trains, airplanes ... ... These means of transport are Channel.Similarly, the definitions from the platform side today sent a message to the user side, news channels: phone, text message, email, client. For example, use nail \"Ding\" functionality will provide the way you select messages touch-up.![Alt Let users do not push the objectionable message, you should pay attention to in the design of these](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7631/26988304804_fdc45cba66.jpg)But there is a question to consider, when the channel is not a single case, how to select channels on stronger demand depends on the message context. For example, this message is trade-related and involves notification of changes in funds, then select the message channel is probably the most reasonable and sound scenarios, note that if you need to \"know\" the user\'s phone number.But if the message for the user side the importance of weak, might have selected client PUSH is more suitable for, because after all, message channel, also involve budget control.Touch timeMessage time touch to the user side right? Push the event immediately triggered or scheduled news.Instant trigger, when the definition of \"event\" occurs when the system push messages directly to the user side. Advantages of immediacy is strong, especially for particularly urgent and important message, be more inclined to select this mode. But the disadvantage is that may result in a poor user experience. Platform users at 2 o\'clock at night received a push message, if this is you, you will not be upset?Timing push, as the name suggests, time pushes define message. Advantage is that the process can be controlled, such as taking into account the user\'s work and living habits, to push the message of the time control in the 10:00-20:00 range, it will reduce the negative emotions of the user message is pushed. In addition, when a major change occurs when content or message notification channel, control and flexibility are all OK. But the disadvantage is that often causes message backlog queue often result in message delay. [Ted Baker phone cases](http://leathercraft.bravesites.com/entries/general/spring-of-2016-apple-product-launches)So the more reasonable option, that is, depending on the message requirement, push time to select a different mode.Frequency control [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7sLcl50WAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7sLcl50WAk) Frequency control, also known as fatigue control. What\'s that supposed to mean? Today I would like to inform you of one thing, notice 1 is OK, but the same message I sent you 10 times in one day, you do not trouble trouble?Similarly, the touch-up on the frequency of the message must make reasonable control. Otherwise, over time, is experiencing problems will lead to complaints, resulting in user experience injury; second, cause users to feel uncomfortable with this message, inadvertently or intentionally ignored the message notification.He asked you a question, and now cell phone spam messages flooding today, you\'ll also see a message? Or a micro-letter group, a backlog of 200+ sessions, you will click on the sliding screen view it?Target usersWho sent this message to? Mass is a single point of delivery. If it is a single point of delivery, should also be considered if the online maintenance of customer information, there are multiple phone contacts for the same user ID, notice should be given to which phone number.In that case, our default choice takes the first phone number. If you ask, if the phone number has been deactivated, users do not receive messages how to solve? Cannot be solved. After all, uncontrollable, and even financial products, also allows a certain degree of funding loss rate.However, if the client sent the message, this problem may occur the probability is relatively low, the only risk is that users uninstall mobile application.Variable configurationUnder what conditions will exist variables configuration problem? Message copy is fixed by definition is half the half configuration.To cite an example. Describes a message: when the user successfully XXX public concern after platform you want to send a message to inform users about success. This message must be that there are several key variables that need to be configured.#Nickname#, Hello. You have #Operate_time# success, XXX public concern. This is Ali Mant. June\'s personal public number, I knew you were going to go down.Note: the Nickname variable parameter represents the user nickname, Operate_time represents time variable parameters.In fact, given message copy is not the technical issues of concern to students, instead of copy in the variable parameter is the object of technology students focus. Because the variable parameter determines the setting of the key property, influence parameters and access issues. You Get to the point of developing it?So, when development again next time you give a message copy, in order not to affect the development progress of the parameter variables before giving it to them, and then slowly think about how message definitions, this is my summary of a small tip.Of course, if the message content is fixed and variable configuration regardless of the.Clip-Clip-for so long, it is not difficult to find, in fact, a word requirement range code can be born of bad really not a Ding.Therefore, the demand for more reliable, otherwise the said the boat turned over.DigressionWell, combined with today\'s article content, throw a \"communications system\" for everyone to see.[![Alt Ted Baker iPhone case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/apple_case/ted_baker_ip824_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/ted-baker-iphone-5s-case-dog-p-3502.html)Following illustration represents a typical communication system, and contains Roman Jackson presented six elements of communication: the sender (source), channel, receiver, information, context, and coding.![Alt Let users do not push the objectionable message, you should pay attention to in the design of these](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7524/26988311434_83f270ebcd_z.jpg)Interested students can learn on their own.This paper by everyone is the product manager of Lei Feng network (search for \"Lei feng\'s network\" public concern).
